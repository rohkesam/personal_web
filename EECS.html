      <td>Project 1: Statistics</td>
      <td>In this project, I calculated basic statistical calculations on sets of data provided through
        an input file. I calculated count, sum, mean, median, mode, standard deviation, min, max, and percentiles from the data.</td>

        <td>Project 2: Computer Vision</td>
        <td>In this project, I created a seam carving algorithm that resized pictures to given dimensions, while maintaining the integrity of the picture. 
            This was my favorite project because it was a really cool application of programming that I had never considered. Also, implementing the algorithm using matrices was fascinating. </td>

        <td>Project 3: Euchre</td>
        <td>This project involved implementing a playable standard game of Euchre using both human and computer controlled players. 
            This was definitely the hardest project for me because it involved keeping track of many moving parts including the deck, the players' hands, the score, etc. 
            However, through the use of many many helper functions and lots of abstraction the project became much simpler.  </td>

        <td>Project 5: Machine Learning</td>
        <td>In this project, I created a machine learning classifier that identified the topic of piazza posts based on the type of words present. 
            The classifier was first trained on test data and then tested on separate input files to identify the topic of piazza posts.</td>
